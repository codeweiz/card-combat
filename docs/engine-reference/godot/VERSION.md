## Knowledge Gap Warning

The LLM's training data likely covers Godot up to ~4.3. Versions 4.4, 4.5,
and 4.6 introduced significant changes that the model does NOT know about.
Always cross-reference this directory before suggesting Godot API calls.

## Project Platform Notes

- First-party clients target PC, Web, and Mobile.
- Use GDScript for client code because Godot 4 C# projects currently cannot export to Web.
- Console is a later porting target, not a first-party baseline. Godot console shipping requires platform approval and certified third-party or custom porting support.
